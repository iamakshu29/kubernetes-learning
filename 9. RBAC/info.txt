RBAC has two parts

Service Accounts and Roles/ClusterRoles
Service Accounts are special accounts that are used by applications running in pods to interact with the Kubernetes API. 
Each pod can be associated with a Service Account, which provides it with a set of credentials.

Roles and ClusterRoles define a set of permissions that can be granted to Service Accounts. 
Roles are namespaced, meaning they apply to a specific namespace, while ClusterRoles are cluster-wide and can be used across all namespaces.
i.e.
If we want to give access at Namespace level we use Role and RoleBinding
If we want to give access at Cluster level we use ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding.

RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings
They are used to bind Roles and ClusterRoles to Service Accounts.
A RoleBinding grants the permissions defined in a Role to a specific Service Account within a namespace, while a ClusterRoleBinding grants the permissions defined in a ClusterRole to a Service Account across all namespaces.

RBAC Policies
RBAC policies are defined using YAML manifests that specify the Roles, ClusterRoles, RoleBindings, and ClusterRoleBindings. These manifests can be applied to the Kubernetes cluster using the kubectl command-line tool.

In tutorial we will create roles and rolebinding at namespace level only, not at cluster level.


Flow is like
ServiceAccount -> Role -> RoleBinding 
Create manifests for Role and RoleBinding and apply them using kubectl.
