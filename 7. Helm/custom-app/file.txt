>> helm create payments
- helm create: Creates a new Helm chart with a predefined directory structure.

This command generates a new directory called "payments" with the following structure:
payments/
  Chart.yaml          # Information about the chart
  values.yaml        # Default configuration values for the chart
  charts/            # Directory to store dependent charts
  templates/         # Directory for Kubernetes resource templates
  .helmignore        # Patterns to ignore when packaging the chart

You can navigate into the "payments" directory and customize the chart by modifying the files and templates as needed.
>> cd payments

>> helm lint .
- helm lint: Validates a Helm chart for correctness and best practices.
This command checks the "payments" chart for any issues or best practice violations and provides feedback on how to improve the chart.

>> helm package .
- helm package: Packages a Helm chart into a chart archive file.
This command creates a packaged chart file (a .tgz file) in the current directory, which can be shared or uploaded to a Helm repository.

>> helm install my-payments ./payments-0.1.0.tgz
- helm install: Installs a Helm chart on a Kubernetes cluster.
This command installs the "payments" chart from the packaged file and names the release "my-payments". The application defined in the chart will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.

>> helm list
- helm list: Lists all the Helm releases installed on the cluster.
This command displays a list of all Helm releases currently installed in the Kubernetes cluster, including their names, namespaces, and statuses.
This sequence of commands demonstrates the creation, validation, packaging, installation, and listing of a Helm chart for a hypothetical "payments" application.
