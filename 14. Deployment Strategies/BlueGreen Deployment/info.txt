change the service selector to switch between blue and green deployments


# BlueGreen Deployment Strategy
Blue is live and Green is idle or newer version.
To switch traffic from Blue to Green deployment, you need to change the service selector in the Kubernetes service definition.
For example, if your service is currently pointing to the Blue deployment:
selector:
  app: my-app
  version: blue
To switch to the Green deployment, you would update the selector to:
selector:
  app: my-app
  version: green
This change will route all incoming traffic to the Green deployment instead of the Blue deployment.

NOTE 

As we can see for the blue-green Strategy, we need to first create the complete env for new version ie services, deployments....
Once the new version is verified, we can switch the traffic by changing the service selector in older service to point to new version.
Once its stable, we can delete the gree-service, older infra except blue-service

think of it as blue is prod and green is staging.
so once we switch traffic to greeen using prod service, blue infra can be deleted and staging service which has handling green during staging can also be deleted.
