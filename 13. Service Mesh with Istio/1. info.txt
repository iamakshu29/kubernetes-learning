What is Istio?
It is an open-source service mesh that helps manage microservices communication within a K8s cluster.
It abstracts away complex networking logic, making it easier to deploy and scale microservices while ensuring security.

Features:
Traffic mgmt: Route Traffic with features like load balancing, canary releases, retries and failover.
Security: Strong authentication, Mutual TLS, authorization and fine grained access control.
Observability: Gain insights with tracing, monitoring and logging using tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger.
Policy Enforcement: Define and enforce policies for rate limiting, access control and quotas.

To Install Istio on local machine first:
>> curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | sh -
>> cd istio-*/
>> export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

To verify
>> istioctl version

Install Istio in a K8s Cluster:
>> istioctl install --set profile=demo -y

What the difference between above commands?
The first command downloads and installs Istio on your local machine, adding the Istio CLI tools to your PATH for easy access.
The second command installs Istio into your Kubernetes cluster using the demo profile, which is a pre-configured setup suitable for learning and experimentation.

Enable automatic sidecar injection for a namespace: It configures the specified namespace to automatically inject the Istio sidecar proxy into pods when they are created.
>> kubectl label namespace <namespace> istio-injection=enabled

To verify the label:
>> kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection

How to do a manual sidecar injection?
You can manually inject the Istio sidecar proxy into your application pods using the istioctl command.
This command modifies your application deployment file to include the Istio sidecar proxy configuration.
>> istioctl kube-inject -f <your-application-deployment-file>.yaml

Then apply the modified file:
>> kubectl apply -f <modified-application-deployment-file>.yaml
This approach is useful when you want to have more control over which pods receive the sidecar proxy or when automatic injection is not feasible.

To verify if the sidecar proxy is injected:
>> kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
You should see two containers running for each pod: your application container and the Istio sidecar proxy container.

To uninstall Istio from the cluster:
>> istioctl uninstall --purge -y

To verify the uninstallation:
>> kubectl get namespace istio-system


Conclusion:
Istio provides a powerful and flexible way to manage microservices in a Kubernetes environment. 
By abstracting complex networking tasks, Istio enables seamless traffic management, security enforcement, and policy control without modifying application code.

In this guide, we explored Istios key features, from installation to advanced traffic control, security policies, and fault injection techniques. 
With traffic mirroring, canary deployments, rate limiting, and mutual TLS encryption, Istio enhances the resilience, security, and efficiency of microservices at scale.
