In this file Prerequisites for the features of Service Mesh are mentioned

a. Canary Deployment
b. For Enabling mTLS (Mutual TLS)
c. For Fault Injection
d. Traffic Mirroring

=============================================================================================

a. For Canary Deployment
Goal: Gradually shift traffic between two versions (e.g., v1 → v2).

Additional Istio resources required:
1. DestinationRule
which Defines subsets (e.g., v1, v2) based on pod labels.

2. VirtualService <- this is Canary Deployment
Routes traffic between subsets, often by percentage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

b. For Enabling mTLS (Mutual TLS)
Goal: Secure in-mesh traffic via encrypted and authenticated connections.

Additional Istio resources/config:
1. PeerAuthentication — controls mTLS mode per namespace/workload.
2. DestinationRule — clients need to match mTLS mode.
3. Istio Control Plane configuration — Ensure mesh-level PeerAuthentication or MeshConfig has mTLS enabled.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

c. For Fault Injection
Goal: Test resilience by introducing delays or errors.

Additional Istio resources required:
1. VirtualService — defines fault rules for specific routes.
Optional: DestinationRule if subsets are involved.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

d. Traffic Mirroring
Goal: Duplicate live traffic to another version/environment for testing without impacting users.

Additional Istio resources required:
1. VirtualService — mirror live traffic to a different subset or service.
2. DestinationRule — defines subsets (v1, v2).
