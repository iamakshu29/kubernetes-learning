If Ingress exists, it is the only supported entry point for users.
Services are never user-facing.

Multiple applications can be hosted behind a single Ingress resource by defining different rules based on hostnames or paths.

When we use ingress we do not expose services using NodePort or LoadBalancer types. Instead, we use ClusterIP services that are only accessible within the cluster. 
The Ingress controller handles all incoming traffic and routes it to the appropriate service based on the defined rules.

ie we expose ingress, not services.
