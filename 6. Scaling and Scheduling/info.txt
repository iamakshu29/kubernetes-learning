Units
- Mi -> Mebibytes ( binary megabytes)
1 mi = approx 1.05 MB 
- Gi -> Gibibytes ( binary gigabytes)
1 Gi = approx 1.07 GB
- m -> millicores (1/1000 of a core)
1000m = 1 CPU core
250m = 0.25 CPU core


- In HPA
averageUtilization: 50 (target CPU utilization percentage across all pods)
50% of CPU usage across all pods will trigger scaling actions
